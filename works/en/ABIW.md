## New rules of science

The best metaphor to describe [PSS][1] is a blockchain. The system is open for audit: anyone can view and edit the chains; moreover, it's protected from the inside from creating mistakes: in the end of an argument all participants of the discussion choose the most right variant, which is using in the following. This makes incredible possibilities for science.

At first, no more scientific journals. Now the unified dictionary of definitions, created by international standards, and the programs for integration of new data into a gigantic scientific map and arguments between scientific schools exist. Every participant keeps the score of definitions and links opened and sees all the latest evidence in his area of knowledge immediately. Science got a chance to not depend on authorities. 

To verify the conclusions leading from the experimental data there can be a special commission, however, it's not always necessary: in some cases an enumeration of possible options of the results of the experiment allows guessing which is right and how this affects the interpretation of the other phenomenons, and then the experiment is not needed. It occurs in the information field. Logic is the ability to make knowledge from nothing.

In his «Critique of Pure Reason» Immanuel Kant popularizes the terms from Euclid's «Elements»: *a priori* and *a posteriori*. I want to consider the terms I use myself: *a priori mistake* and *a posteriori mistake*. A priori mistake is the accumulation of an error because of the false experience, which we call *the confirmation bias*, and a posteriori mistake can be also called *ex post facto mistake*: the formation of thoughts answering the question based on the known answer. Whether the answer is true is not known, as well as what knowledge is false is unknown, hence the both mistakes can be fixed by building the logic chain from scratch (from some axioms, which, in practice, may be called into question too). The difficulty of this method grows exponentially with the difficulty of the considered system, the method is also can require the unification of knowledge from a whole range of sciences, but look what [results][3] can be obtained. For that, the unified system is needed.

It is worth noting that a priori and a posteriori mistakes are the mirror images of each other in time. This means the statement that the prior knowledge depends on the experience and the posterior depends on an empirical evidence is a bit mistaken: if you have a mathematical data, this data is true if it has unambiguous interpretation, and the rest can contain a mistake depending on the experience (see [the conflict between materialism and idealism][16]). To visualize the reflection in time, we can use the diagram with response options, where the wrong data narrows the range of possible interpretations:

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/1.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 1. A priori and a posteriori mistakes</p>
</p>

From now on, if you want to argue with anybody on anything, you should take a piece of paper or electronic canvas and start drawing. Moreover, I want to discuss argument strategy.

There is a scientific convention called «Burden of proof». If you want to affect somebody's opinion, providing arguments and proofs is exactly your job. But this principle does not reveal the other side: the duty of the other, if your evidence defeated his arguments, is to change his opinion and consider this evidence. Thus, the main principle of the discussion is more like the quote from «Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality» by Eliezer Shlomo Yudkowsky:

*He had lingered in the Ravenclaw common room long enough to collect a few signatures that might be useful to Hermione later. Not many students had signed; wizards hadn’t been trained to think in the __put-up-or-shut-up__, stick-your-neck-out-and-make-a-prediction-or-stop-pretending-to-believe-in-your-theory rules of Muggle science*.

There is a finite number of interpretations of any information. Interpretation is setting the additional content depended on subjective parameters. An increase of the initial information improves the interpretation efficiency. We call the lack of information, leading to wrong interpretation, *survivorship bias*. 
 
Even if you don't use PSS, every participant of the discussion must understand what the others offer, have these ideas in his mind, and compare with his own ideas. In other words, all participants should have the same [*context*][7] (what is difficult to achieve without using diagrams or any other graphical methods of information representation). This method doesn't work in court, where the participants have incentives to conceal the part of information (see [the strategy of deceit][5]). «Put up or shut up» also includes «You criticize you propose»:

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/2en.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 2. The strategy of discussions</p>
</p>

From now on, even a subjective information can be considered objectively and can be used as a part of science. In my articles I can talk about subjective things can be deciphered. I have no more chance to lie: you can easily verify what is useful interpretation.

When I talk about fantastic things (it's about [the algorithms of thinking][15]), you can make sure it is possible (and no matter sometimes you need a supercomputer), and the final purpose of cognition for you is to evaluate if you can do the same. You can and should represent all that have written in these articles as PSS, by learning to imagine it.

It is possible to use metaphors in science, and I will use it in this article. The skill of searching and using metaphors allows accelerating the thinking and connect it to the imagination, when the right visualization allows working wonders in remembering and reproducing the essence of the events and understanding of mathematical concepts.

## Definitions

Let's demonstrate the efficiency of the above-mentioned methods. Now we will define things like Ancient Greeks did:

*The toast is a bread and butter. But wait! It can be the toast with a cheese. Hence is the toast a bread and something else? Let's try: the toast with a honey, the toast with a sawdust, the toast with a mattress, the toast with a car... Well, something doesn't add up. What divides the things coincided from the ones that didn't? Maybe the toast is a bread and something eatable? And why did I think about the butter at first? That's because the Russian word «buterbrod» came from the German «butter» and «brot». And what is a sandwich? Is it two breads and something eatable? No, they need to be arranged in a certain order, therefore, the toast is the two pieces of bread and something eatable between. Let's verify this rule in the previous chain. Is the bread on cheese the toast? Yes, because there is a famous Soviet carton «Three from Buttermilk», where the cat named Matroskin advises eating the toast upside down. Also there is a meta of sandwich, the definition of which is two of something flat and something between. In other words, the thing without bread can also be the toast, but there will be a metaphor. And also it can be the [irony][7]:* 


<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
It was bad weather.<br>
The sky was frowning angrily.<br>
A man was walking through the city<br>
And ate a sandwich without bread.<br>
(R. G. Mukha)
</p>

*Well, if we defined the metaphor and the irony, considered all the options, we can conclude that the most exact definition of a toast is a bread and something eatable:*

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/3.jpg" width=600>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 3. The definition of a toast</p>
</p>

This is how to give definitions correctly: using the algorithm of binary search, approximate the answer from two sides, define what the object is and what it isn't. Narrow and wide definitions don't exist, because the maximally wide definition is the most right. There's no need to highlight the criterias particularly, because the presence of criterias is tempting to think that if something does not meet the criteria, it isn't this object by definition. But the definition does perform this function yet!

*Dear programmers, the binary search, of course, is a great thing, but when you try to guess a woman's age, don't say 50 first and then 25...*

What about complex concepts? Well, let's define the society. One human is not a society, hence society is a group of... people? But if there is a society of dragons in fantasy books, this is the society too, isn't it? It seems like the criteria of life is necessary (Let's not touch the [definition of life][17] yet), hence the society is a group of living creatures. All people on earth is not always a society, because there are French society, English society. Let's add the knowledge of history, ideology, and other things and obtain that the *society* is an autonomous group of living creatures enchained by the division of labour.

This gives a quite accurate data. The potential autonomy is what divides Europe into the French, English, and other societies. The primitive society appeared when one person made a bone biface for the others or built a fire, for which he was appointed a bonfire handler. If the parts of the group aren't enchained by the division of labour, they are autonomous. Many creatures are able to the labour division, so is the group of gorillas society? No. And we can't say «Well, if we have that definition, now this is society too». Let's add the criteria of [intelligence][17]. The group of rescuers is not society, because it needs the equipment, the Internet, and the transport. If we watch an apocalyptic movie, where such group becomes the sole survivor, it can become the society at the moment it starts to make new culture. It doesn't fit the definition, but is seems this is necessary. Hence here it comes our new definition of *society*: an autonomous group of intelligent creatures united by the common culture. It turns out the division of labour is necessary for the culture as [strategical][5] phenomenon. And this group without autonomy should be called a *community*.

And a very funny situation happens in Russian science with the economy. The first is using in the statement «the economy of a business», meaning the internal processes, and the second is using for mathematical description of all things related to money and other resources. Economy should have one definition: this is [the branch of strategy that studies resources][5].

## Pseudoscience?

Sigmund Freud, the author of 1899 «The Interpretation of Dreams», is frequently criticized for a priori mistake: Oedipus complex is subjective and is just a part of the Freud's mind, it's not universal. That is [true][17]. But we don't talk about it. Sigmund Freud's writings caused a very loud debate, then a scientific revolution occurred, and the psychology that we know well came. And it still includes the concepts of Oedipus and Electra complexes (The last was introduced by Carl Jung in 1913). This all means the mistake helped the development of science. I will show below that there is no truth no need to put in question, and all mistakes are relative. Sooner or later, the most efficient theory will displace the rest:

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/4.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 4. The science based on a mistake</p>
</p>

What if I told you there is a whole pseudoscience without studying which I couldn't have never done these discoveries, and the pattern of transforming the mistake into some useful knowledge is the same? Basically, this pseudoscience is a theory of mindsets, brainstorming sessions, and algorithms of thinking. One of many attempts to comprehend what still doesn't have any scientific form. It called Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and the books about it can be found in the bookstore in esoteric section (don't read it, the stunt performed by professionals). That's what they say about it in wide circles:

*<…> NLP techniques are aimed at copying and modeling of a behavior of people successful in a certain area to acquire their skills. There are no scientific proofs in favour of the efficiency of NLP, it recognized as pseudoscience. Systematic reviews indicate that NLP is based on the outdated notions of the structure of the brain, is incompatible with modern neuroscience and includes a number of factual errors. Characteristic pseudoscientific terminology used in NLP is noted. <…> (Wikipedia in Russian)*

The outdated notions of the structure of the brain. «Well-well». That's what my friend is used to say when I told him about this theory, which is closely related to the placebo effect (as well as Freud psychoanalysis). But someone should apologize: I shaped it up. There is nothing actually valuable in these books, but I clutched the idea of deciphering and copying mindsets courtesy of the placebo, with great difficulty, but still separated the wheat from the chaff, and got incredibly great results (see [trust][15]). 

However, I still don't want to associate myself with this science. We are talking about *the theorem of trust*: the desired always lies in the field of the unknown. Due to the activities of some pseudoscientists not having the competence and authority, the rest of scientists place a barrier to this knowledge, denying those valuable links. Should we really consider that human beliefs, associative memory, and our monkey skill of copying the behavior don't affect anything and can't be investigated scientifically? No. For the Grand Unified Science Theory, which I have almost finished, it's necessary to investigate everything, and the theorem of trust tells that psychology is the least explored, therefore there must be the most new links to the other sciences from it. And so [it happens][6]. No area of knowledge should be devalued. There is still a problem with the trust of the scientists we need to solve.

What conspiracy theories do you know? The existence of a world government, the Anunnaki from planet Nibiru, horoscopes, the theory about life in the Matrix, the existence of a God... Wait. Is the God a conspiracy theory? Let's think about. 

*There is a [photo][NASA alien spaceship] in the NASA archive, which depicts the alien spaceship. 12 thousand years ago the residents of ε (Epsilon) Boötis (a constellation containing Arcturus, which patch of sky borders with Ursa Major) flew 203 light years and parked it there. For 12 600 years the star system have been emitting the radio signal, and one of the scientists studying the world echo (random noises) found regularities in it, made a plot and got the image of Boötis constellation. Later, NASA deleted the photo of from their website.*

Yes, I have written a self-proving paragraph. There are more things in this theory, but I didn't include completely fictional pieces. The photo was actually removed, but many other media was removed because of a maintenance on the site, and all it was restored later. The «scientist» proved to be the amateur astronomer who didn't know anything about this photo, and apologized, admitting that he interpreted the data in a wrong way. The riddle of the noise isn't solved yet, but there are natural [versions][Explanations for Long Delayed Echoes], one of which is reflection of the terrestrial signal back from the clouds of ionized gas. And the «alien spaceship» is a thermal insulating cover. During the *STS088* mission (from which the photo) the purpose of which was to dock the second module of the ISS, «Unity», to the first, «Zarya», the cover accidentally went into space. Such covers are used to prevent heat leakage through the bolts, connecting docked modules, into space. That is visible a characteristic shape of the cover in the photo, and the moment right after its losing was caught on a [video][STS88 debris downlink excerpt] (Thanks to Cosmos Prosto for the [review (in Russian)][Cosmos prosto conspiracy theory] of this theory):

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/5.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 5. A conspiracy theory</p>
</p>

The classical conspiracy theories are the mix of false and true links. They are usually being dispelled by fixing of the survivorship bias, which is searching for new data. But there are theories like «We live in the simulation»: it can't be proved or disproved. We don't just know the parameter on which it depends, and probably we could find a way to prove the Universe can be created in simulation, and this means we will never know (actually I have quite good [thoughts][17] this is false). The Fermi paradox is also this kind of theory. 

The feature of such theories is they may not contain false links at all. Religious theories also have this feature. The God exists, because everything exist. Only what you can't think of doesn't exist, but you can think of anything. If you want to convince yourself something doesn't exist, you can only conceal that (to destroy the object, you need to destroy the links). Never say «To prove a fact». Fact is not provable, fact is what you can only see (in the real world or your imaginary), and link is what can be proved. If you believe in God, you can «see» it, because you can think of it. It turns out if you don't you still can. The question is not «Does the God exist?», but «Is God connected to the substantive validity?», «What is God?», «Why the God?». Why not something else?

A religious theory is some coordinate system, which can explain the structure of reality quite fully. So why you shouldn't believe in God? How to get out of this coordinate system? Find more efficient theory.

The direct mission of our brain is to understand the structure of reality as good as possible (this is not a biological fact, just a cultural regularity). It's no wonder that religious theories were popular during all human history, and were displaced by cosmogony, biogony and psychology (the last still have upheavals). But how to distinguish the more efficient theory? It unites more facts. 

If you don't live in a trap of the [narcissism][6], the old theory becomes not tenable and gives a way to the one more efficient. Gives a way, but not being denied. Thus, the theory of the flat Earth can be the reality until you will find strangeness in star surveillance or the ship going out to the horizon. Old links remain: the Earth is flat when you can neglect its shape. Otherwise, we can say with the same success that the Newtonian physics is a conspiracy theory, because it is used about always, besides the cases of using relativity equations. We need only to remove false links, so it doesn't turn out the following:

*It's long been understood that there were people on one side and dinosaurs on the other. Then, a meteorite fell to the center of the side with dinosaurs, and the Earth curled up into a lump like a dumpling. People got to the outside, dinosaurs inside, and now we sometimes dig them up.*

Remembering that logic is the ability to make knowledge from nothing, we can disprove a theory without additional facts, but this still doesn't help to draw the line between old theories and conspiracy theories. It turns out the scientific rule we should use when comparing different theories is «This is more efficient, so now we believe in this». This is also reflected on the strategic diagram on the figure 2. Many people have problems with skepticism and trust: it is needed to calculate probabilities of outcomes instead of rejecting the information. If you haven't seen blue apples, you can't prove it doesn't exist, but you can prove apples get their color for some reasons, and you will know the conditions under which apples become blue and the reasons why you haven't seen it. Similarly, the religion is a valuable and undisputable part of human culture. Thus, no matter what does this mean, if you believe in God and nobody can suggest you something better, you should continue believing. Your personal science will not suffer while you are doubting. 

The problem of the devaluation of knowledge of God in European culture appeared at the beginning of widespread criticism of Christianity during Modern history. Rationalism make people rely only on empirical and formal proofs, but not redistribution of old links. This led to the fact that modern psychology is in no way connected to the culture. And as a result, ancient Greek mythology [turned out to be][6] the more valuable source of knowledge for my theory than psychology. So I have the courage to call a denial of God the second largest loss in a history of science ([here][6] we talk about the first). 

## Science revolutions

Continuing the thesis of the previous chapter: is it true that this work was published the first time in 2023, which is the year of a rabbit, and hence symbolizing guile? This sentence is false. Truth is the statement not containing mistakes. But we can't just say that's a rubbish and ignore it, we need to decompose the chain, define what's true, measure through the folders of knowledge, and save in memory. You need to build a large machine for sorting seeds. This way you can learn statements that are separately true: the work was published in 2023; 2023 is a rabbit year; the rabbit symbolizes guile.

When you consider potentially fake (I mean any) news, you can use a scientific approach. At first, you need to fix a priori mistake, oddly enough, without getting new information from the outside. You can see the fact (title, sentence, picture), which can be decomposed into smaller ones while remaining the part of the whole picture. Which combinations and scenarios of appearing this information are there, and what's the probability of each? To know it, you must firstly destroy the links with the expectations of this fact. The chain destruction-extrapolation-enumeration turns out, that creates a correct algorithm of a [doubt][6]. This is the solution of the problem with skepticism. The news is further only the result of the experiment for you, changing depending on certain conditions. You no longer need reputation mechanisms like credibility of a newspaper. «In the information age, when every person leaves a lot of digital blueprints, you can't take people at their word. Modern journalism is so much based on verbal evidence, that it remains the most common way of manipulation» (There must be the author, but I can't find the original quote. Addressing the author, if you want me to mention you, please send me your variant of this quote). I always use this method in science.

Remembering that all exist, we will consider mathematical theorems, but first, let's consider one more aspect. Albert Einstein wanted to prove and proved that gravity doesn't exist. He meant the gravity has other reasons, and it is not the others think. The parallel: people didn't prove what is God actually, what is this phenomenon of mind and where it comes from. 

Exactly such position of abdication let Einstein abstract from existing theories, but only to destroy old links and rebuild it, getting better result. I did it all the time: the slightest mismatch means the whole theory can be mistaken. Not everyone is ready for such labour-intensive work, hence there are two types of science.

I want to thank Derek Muller, the author of [Veritasium][Veritasium] YouTube channel, for this thought (this [video][About Scientific Revolutions] was published on his second channel based on the book «The Structure of Scientific Revolutions» by Thomas Kuhn). A *regular science* is adding and verifying the knowledge about existing theories, refining the measurements, making gradual and systematic progress, and also asking the questions about what couldn't be explained. The science answering these questions is *revolutionary science*, which is looking at the things from that angle, from which there are no paradoxes (see below). Solving the paradoxes always require revolutionary science, because of the following.

Let's say you wanted to call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is the present paradigm of quantum physics, into question. Is there a probability it is false? Of course! But the most of the scientists don't argue on it. If you come to them and say you want to work on it, they will advise you first to read the books about the basis of quantum mechanics, watch lectures, and get knowledge (this was a hypothetical case until there was exactly the same conversation with my friend from The Department of Theoretical Physics of MIPT). Here comes the problem. If I do as these scientists, finish Oxford, read all popular writings on this subject, and get their knowledge, I will get the same mistakes. This means the fact I don't have any academic education can only increase the probability that I will make scientific revolution (This still depends on hard work). The same situation with age: I am not inclined to conservatism and ready to change all my beliefs, not enchained by reputation and formal rules of the scientific community. It turns out that to make a scientific revolution you need not only to disagree with others, but to not delve into links between the concepts at all, trying to interpret phenomenons around with your own way (I get information from the popular science videos). For this reason, I always write scenarios of science videos before I watch it or process the information in it, guessing the content on the base of knowledge about science, protecting from another's a priori mistake.

## Tools

The human civilization tried many times to create the systems to describe everything at least in math. In 1930, on the mathematical congress in Königsberg Austrian locician Kurt Gödel unveiled, and in a year published *the incompleteness theorems*, proving that, applicable to arithmetic, there are theorems that can not be proved or disproved. To prove the theorems, Gödel developed his own system, in which any logic statement has its unique *Gödel number*. Every symbol has a related number, and the statement can be represented as the product of prime numbers starting from $2$, each elevated to a power of the number of the symbol. I use the variant of the system on which Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman [worked][Gödel's proof] (this does not change the essence):

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/6en.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 6. Gödel's system </p>
</p>

To denote the number $2$ you should use the $ss0$ statement, which is equivalent to $2^7\*3^7\*5^6=4,374,000,000$. This way we can denote any formula. Here is the Giuseppe Peano's third axiom: $¬(sx=0) = 2^1\*3^8\*5^7\*7^13\*11^5\*13^6\*17^9 =$ $something$ $with$ $43$ $numbers$. This is the number of this axiom in Gödel's system. The proof of any theorem looks horrible in numerical equivalent, but we need this system only as a concept. Then, we say that some numbers can be denoted by letters $a,b,c$, and so on. Thus, there is the number $g$ that means «There is no proof for the statement with Gödel number $g$». To represent this statement logically, Kurt showed that Gödel numbers can denote a paradoxical self-referential statement («This statement is false»). This way he proved the theorem of incompleteness. And I'm going to disprove it.

If I'm going to explain everything at all, I need to explain how the formal systems structured. Let me introduce *The caterpillar of formality*:

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/7.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 7. The caterpillar of formality</p>
</p>

As it [was said][1], the formal system contains only the stable connections. Any statement in such system is called *strictly true*. Do you see these dark areas? This is [horror][6]. The truth of any statement with equal sign or any other reversible (having an antonym) symbol in it means that all the rest statements in some set are false. Thus, according to the logical axiom $A=A$, $1=1$, therefore the number $1$ can't be equal to any other number. It is shown in the figure that all the numbers united in one set, but there's nothing about an order of the numbers. There is also another problem: the numbers don't form even half-stable links with the $2x$ set. The both problems can be solved by the functions:

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/8.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 8. The functions</p>
</p>

The series of the natural numbers traditionally denotes by the function of the next integer, which makes the size of the set of the functions conditionally infinite (don't confuse it with $∞$). Now, the certain value of $x$ is strictly linked with a certain value of $f(x)$. Obviously, only monotonous functions defined on the entire straight line (or the other functions with bijection of parameters and values), and also such functions are called reversible. Don't forget that stable link is not the equal sign: as well as the main logical axiom sets boundaries between numbers, any function has rules of transforming the argument into the result. This is an algorithmic reproducibility: we made a swimming pool lanes to make swimmers not intersect. But the set of the functions still don't have stable links with their elements (because $f(1)$ is not the same that $f(2)$). This can be explained the following way: a formal system is a [reality][15]. Imagine you create the Universes and specify the values of the parameters influencing the internal processes (the gravitational constant). The Universes with different values of the parameters will not intersect. This means the presence of a function with unknown parameter makes some uncertainty, and the system becomes formal only when you determine the value. 

Now we can determine a minimal set of axioms needed for arithmetic:  
1) There are natural numbers.  
2) Any number is equal to itself.  
3) The numbers go one by one in a certain order.

That's all. The rest is theorems. *A theorem* is a rule setting new links. *A rule* is a function setting only stable links. *An axiom* is a rule without arguments. At the first glance, this is not true. I will comment:  
For the first axiom: the object exists.  
For the second axiom: there is a logical operation of equality. The theorem defining the operator tells that $∀A:A=A$. And this does not depend on an argument, just look at the figure:

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/9.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 9. The logical axiom of equality</p>
</p>

For the third axiom: there is a straight line (it's not necessary to introduce the concept of the line). There are different numbers on it. Therefore, the numbers have a certain order. 

The third axiom directly follows from the properties of space. Just like the second. The axioms form the reality of arithmetic, the borders going beyond which you will leave the area of arithmetic. Now let's prove theorems.

*There is no number equals to other number* (this could be one of the axioms). Let's consider two different numbers. Their equality violates the axiom $3$.

*The theorem of infinitude of the numbers*. Axioms does not limit the amount of numbers. From the third axiom follows there is a number after $x$. Thus, we can use it an infinite number of times.

*The theorem of the next number*. There is a function $S(x)$ returning the next number after the $x$.

*The theorem of the greater*. If you can reach $y$ executing $S(x)$, $y$ is greater than $x$.

*The theorem of addition*. Addition is a function $A(x,y)$ executing $S(x)$ for $y$ times.

*The theorem of multiplication*. Multiplication is a function $M(x,y)$ executing $A(x,x)$ for $y$ times.

*The theorem of subtraction*. Subtraction is a function $B(x,y)$ returning a such number $a$ that $A(y,a)=x$.

*The theorem of division*. Division is a function $D(x,y)$ returning a such number $a$ that $M(y,a)=x$.

We didn't define natural numbers, but it is needed for the axioms. And to solve problems with appearing non-natural numbers (zero, negative and fractional) by using our functions, we add new axioms about existing such numbers, verifying all the links between old and new axioms. Logical unification allows leaving always true axioms $2$ and $3$ in place. Notice that my axioms hasn't broken on adding new operations besides Peano's ones. It's important not to miss that we should replace the word «number» to «natural number» in many theorems, but there's no problem in mathematical language.  

And now we add an exponentiation and irrational numbers, as a consequence, and get the true statements:

<p style="text-align: center">$x^0=1; 0^x=0; 0^0=1; 0^0=0; 1=0$</p>

Ouch. 

This is called paradox. The hole in the rules of reality. Paradox is a mistake of a formal system where one rule allows existing of a link, but the other forbids it. I show this on the glimmering link:

<p>

    <p class="pdesc">Figure 10. A paradox</p>
</p>

Generally speaking, a theorem can not break the axioms. It just shouldn't be connected to something not exist in reality defined by axioms, thus there should be the limit of the range of definition. This means there shouldn't be not only the negative and fractional numbers, but zero. But we are such meticulous that we decide to change the axioms. Now there is a choice again: don't use one of the rules making a paradox, or make another axiom. Let's make one: $0^0=0$. Because this is more convenient. 

There is one more scientific rule following: exception does not confirm the rule, it tells about another rule. This means penguins and ostriches make a new rule: either not all the birds can fly, and there are flying and not flying, or they are not birds. I vote for the first. And this all is tempting to think that paradoxes, as well as mistakes, can be divided into groups: the previous paradox was fusing, this is the paradox of inclusion, and there are also paradoxes of value and [assignment][15].

While we are talking about exceptions, there is a whole genre of seeking regularities in the absenting links! We highlight prime and irrational numbers from the integers we can't divide, and imaginary numbers from ones from which we can't take the square root. Here's a riddle for you: find a function $I(x)$ returning an irrational number with the serial number $x$ from zero. The answer is in the end of the article.

The paradoxes of the real systems are also solvable by looking from different angle, changing the rules. In 1901, Bertrand Russel found the paradox of self-reference in the promising Cantor theory of sets: 

If there is a set of all sets, it must contain itself. Then, it is also included into the set of all sets containing themselves. Let there be a set of all sets not containing themselves. Then, this set both contains and does not contain itself.

If you read [the first article][1] carefully, you can guess. Every set contains itself by the definition. If $A⊂B$, and $B$\$A=∅$, then $A=B$. The set of all sets contains all the sets, because it contains all objects can be united into a set. The $⊂$ and $∈$ are the same. The set of all sets containing themselves is actually the set of all sets, and it contains itself. Thus, the set of all sets not containing themselves is empty. And it doesn't contain itself, because the set containing only the empty set is empty. Because sets does not exist, only the objects.

This way we can also solve the barber paradox, which is a daily life interpretation of the self-reference paradox. If the barber both should and can't shave himself, his existence is controversial. And if there is no barber, all people in the village shave themselves.

One more famous paradox is grandfather paradox (I get a little upset, knowing I am not the first who came up with the solution). You go back in time, kill your grandfather and do not allow yourself to bear and do this. From what angle should we look to make the paradox disappear?

If the Universe is a set of particles interacting each other by very complex rules, some initial conditions will always lead to similar results. With all the charms like the accumulation of error over time, but still this makes predestination of the past. You can look at such timeline from the side, breaking free from the illusion the human is at the center of the show. Let's not think of: If you were born in one Universe and went to another where you shouldn't bear, you changed the world line and both the Universes by the fact of creation of the portal. Also, if you created a time loop, it will exist in the world line. Thus, there are world lines with loops and without (as ours, at least, I haven't noticed one). And if you try to spot the moment this infinite loop started at, you won't find it. Because there never been a moment the loop was created. It was always there:
 
<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/11.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 11. World lines</p>
</p>

This speaks that time travel is most likely impossible, but these loops probably can exist in a condition of interruption in the continuum. That is [unlikely][3] too. 

And now the critique of Gödel.

The third Peano axiom is not an axiom. It is a theorem proving by the following: if zero is the first number (by the axiom of the existence of a zero), there is no number before it. If we add negative numbers, the theorem will be false. How the axiom can affect the validity of a theorem? As well as the Pythagorean theorem, following directly from the properties of space, stop working in hyperbolic geometry.

All natural numbers, being factorized to primes and converted into Gödel system, divide into three categories: nonsense ($21,093,750=¬⊃($), lies ($0=1$) and truth ($0=0$). Even in these simple examples the lie and the truth can be distinguished only by proving from the axioms and theorems. In Gödel system there is such operation instead of $⇒$ sign: $Theorem=2^{statement_1}\*3^{statement_2}$.

Gödel used a function returning is the statement provable to create the number $g$. We will talk below about Hilbert's criterias, the last of which is 
«Is there an algorithm determining whether the statement can be proved from the axioms?» And how Gödel answered this question true, if the Turing machine appeared only five years after Kurt's publication (Alan Turing was developed his machine in purpose to answer this question) and answered false? Moreover, Gödel answered the first question «Is there a way to prove everything?» false by himself. 

You can prove the provability of everything, but not the improvability of anything, without answering this question. And with it too! Think of: if you know there is an insoluble problem, what makes you think that a certain problem is insoluble? To prove the undecidability means to prove the paradox, and then the system requires changing of axioms to make all provable. The system aims to a full provability. And this question makes sense only if the answer is «true». 

Moreover, there's no need to use two continuums of words. To prove or disprove means to determine the lie or the truth, and before this moment the validity is unknown. If the truth is the series of statements without mistakes, any paradox is a lie, but it can be proved: $2^{x^0=1}\*3^{0^x=0}\*5^{0^0=1}\*7^{0^0=0}\*11^{1=0}$ (The disadvantage of Gödel system is in the absence of the signs for a consequence of several statements and a contradiction). We determined the truth that this is false. This paradox contradicts the axiom defining the operator of equality. Hence, this statement (this series of stable links uniting both functions with a zero) does not belong to the reality of arithmetic. And until we determine the truth, the value of $0^0$ is actually undefined.  

And the Gödel paradox does the same! $g=$ «There is no proof for the statement with Gödel number $g$». This is wrong! If you can prove $g$, this means $g≠ <⋯>$, and it is equal to something else. «There is a proof of $g$» $≠$ «There is no proof of $g$». If you disprove $g$, it will be the same! «There is a proof, that there is no proof, that there is no proof...». This mistake occurred because the function received $g$ and returned the improvability of $g$, had no idea about what is $g$. The function just didn't have a bijection. Kurt Gödel broke an axiomatic of his own system and entangled mathematicians for almost a hundred years.

The congress in 1930, where Kurt unveiled his works, discussed Hilbert's questions, of which spoke from the beginning of the century. David Hilbert wanted to put mathematics on the axiomatic track, and asked three questions, which are called Hilbert's criterias:   
1) Is there a way to prove all that is true?  
2) Is mathematics free of contradictions?  
3) Is there an algorithm determining whether the statement can be proved from the axioms?

I'll give such answers:  
1) Yes. Any system, even determining infinite sets, has a finite number of links due to grouping objects. The absence of any link between two parts of the systems means there are two different systems (realities) (look at the figure 5 with a conspiracy theory). The same thing happens while violating the axioms.  
2) Yes. In the system to where we added a zero and exponentiation, there are no special cases of the functions $f(x)=0^x$ and $g(x)=x^0$ for the value of $x=0$. They exist in the other reality. Remember that the functions with different argument value are different functions. At the same time, we always can add more axioms, solving paradoxes.  
3) Yes, and Gödel numbers are the such system. Simple enumeration of all options will once point to a valid proof of a statement or paradox from the axioms. Familiar to us algorithms, based on the Turing machine, also can solve this task. 

Finally, PSS, being [the algorithm mind][17], can prove the validity of any non-paradoxical statement, the consistency of itself (what was also the important question after appearing of Gödel's theorems), and also it can reveal the paradoxes, and hence, talk about provability.

One more thank to Veritasium for the detailed [video][Veritasium Math's Fundamental Flaw] about many themes of this chapter. In the end of the video, there is a paradox Alan Turing answered the third question false because of. It's also solvable, try to solve it yourself. When you watch this video, you will laugh about how foolish these problems seem after reading their solution:) 

The conclusion from this chapter is: *the truth is all that is not paradoxical*. The paradoxes can be created only by mistakes in the axioms we created, these axioms are called in our reality paradigms, and the more of them we break, the better will be our understanding of the Universe. 

## Visualizations

This chapter is perfect for resting from the collapse of the notions of truth that occurs in your brain right now. 

To make metaphors build correctly, you should consider many cases of comparing the objects, including dynamical. For example, the house is a bad metaphor for the identity. If you destroy the house, you won't have any place to live, there can be wet, and your associative thinking may not find a way out of the cell. What is different is the city. You can resettle in another area, get out of the rain and wait for the sun. Everyone should draw his own unique parallels, because with connecting links you are training your metaphorical thinking and imaginary. With time, you learn now to find mistakes in metaphor as well as in words.  

Spy two random items. Item is a noun, it can be a non-material concept (charge, anatomy, time), but not a process (swimming, excitement). We will stack them four ways. Let's say that precise item is item the way it is in the real world, its model (non-material won't fit there), and abstract item is meta of the item (or metaitem) containing the information about ways of transforming this item (usually it's a change in the shape: the box can be opened) and from which other metaitems it is formed (a mug consists of a handle and a glass, a car consists of wheels, a body, glass, and so on). This exercise is stacking this items in different ways. Try to do this yourself before reading the following: 

*Abstract mug + precise Universe*. We need something to put on the mug like a texture. The mug may consist of neutron star material. The mug can be transparent and contain red clouds of hydrogen dust inside the glass. The mug on my table is curved down, where else can that happen in the Universe? Close to black hole! So we may make the bottom of the mug back. There will be a hoop of refracted light going up from it, and the rest surface will be covered with stars. The mug has also a handle. We need something with a hole. Could be no thought, the rings of Saturn! They will be the handle.

*Precise washing machine and precise lightbulb*. Sometimes these combinations can also succeed. You know what to do. But we also can integrate a lightbulb into the washing machine, but for what? To indicate something. Thus, two precise objects will carry out their functions. 

*Abstract box + abstract time*. The complexity has increased. We're dealing with interactions of ideas. If the box stores objects, it can be the storage for time. We need to use the properties of time. For that, we need a good understanding of the links within metas. Time is fluid, and let's consider our box is hermetic. The time is under pressure in it, and once you open the box, it pours right down on you! Hmm, what could it mean? This idea is not suitable, because we don't know how it feels when time shoots jets. It could be at the beginning of the Universe. But an accumulator in which you can put your free time (and move to the next working day), and then take stopping the clock, is a good idea. This way, you can collect almost 8 hours of sleep by taking 15 minutes each day.

*Abstract Universe + precise mug*. Can do. Imagine the Universe where everything consist of mugs. You should think through all the details: colorful quark-mugs in the atoms hang together by handles, there are pulsars spitting a tea, a gigantic supermassive black mug with through hole in the center of the galaxy torquing grains of sugar. The more you know about the Universe, the better you are at.

Here we use not only addition. All the [operations][15] can be the basis for your imagination. Thus, there are moving (football stadium layed of newspapers instead of grass), unvaluing (a lightbulb shining dark) and even such constructions as [irony][7] (glass pencil, shapeless ball). Everything listed above is telling that we need to build as many precise models in terms of [strategy][5] as possible of every thing in the world to make concepts in our horizon link more firmly.

There's something common between every good visualization method. It uses two spatial and one temporal dimension. The third spatial dimension appears, when we need to consider the object from different angles, and sometimes we can successfully do this by one two-dimensional picture, leaving the rest of the work to imagination. But no one would like if we had three-dimensional letters. Complex constructions can not be perceived in three dimensions as well. We can consider this a consequence of the axiom of two-dimensional vision. There are projections with two spatial dimensions, where the time represents itself. We can conditionally divide them into maps (top view) and slices (front view), but let's call it all maps. By making video of maps we can get timelapses. There are also projections using a trick with the tearing of the whole space into pieces in different time periods. Let's call it trajectories. For these projections, making a video means adding the second temporal dimension. Maps include PSS, blueprints. Two-dimensional computer games are based on this idea. And trajectories include flowcharts, [strategical diagrams][5], and even regular functions: it is all possible values (body positions) depended on an argument (time). Complex functions make a video for them, shifting the object in all time periods in parallel. There are very unusual ways of distorting the space on maps (nomograms) and trajectories (Gantt charts), that we should use and explore. 

The reason of a broken window theory is in the majority opinion effect. This is a complex statement, because in contains a great amount of links in the definitions of concepts interacting. To understand this better, you should describe it in detail. The effect of growth of the levels of crime in result of watching smaller levels of crime and the absence of methods of dealing with it occurs because of the feature of the most people of striving to have similar beliefs with people around. I don't quite agree: the theory of broken windows works, also in the opposite direction (the theory of intact windows, but the reason is passivity of society in relation to crime problem, and the properties such as conformism depend on [trust][16], which has negative correlation with high levels of crime. To understand this, we should have been done as in famous genre of memes: 

<p>
    <img class="pimg" src="../../../images/ABIW/12en.jpg" width=400>
    <p class="pdesc">Figure 12. Decomposition</p>
</p>

To not get confused in tons of definitions, we need a unified dictionary matching words with their exact definitions. But words can be uncomfortable for displaying on schemes. We can designate unified symbolic, which allows denoting definitions using hieroglyphic letter. If we do this for every meta, there will be big progress. So one of the things I'm working on right now is an artificial language with strategy as an alphabet, and the context of idea describes by the other tools.

## Some conclusions

1) Pseudosciences are useful, because you must squeeze all the juice out of everything in the world for science;
2) The existence of God is just as real as the existence of the numbers, because they both are in other realities (use this in both directions);
3) PSS has to become a new media format, applicable to typography, multimedia presentations, and making video content on any topic;
4) We should reform education in schools and universities starting to teach logic (theory of algorithms) and strategy. Training of teachers and preparing training materials take a lot of time, so we need to start now.

We had a riddle: find a function $I(x)$ returning an irrational number with the serial number $x$ from zero. The smallest irrational number has infinite zeros in its fractional part, and $1$ after them. We can't use notation of infinitives, but let's denote something new. $I(1)=0.(\dot{0})1$. Then, the next number is $I(2)=0.(\dot{0})2$, and, in general, $I(x)=0.(\dot{0})x$. Then, $I(10)=0.(\dot{0})10=0.(\dot{0})1=I(1)$. That's because $I(x)=\underset{—}{\overset{—}{\dot{∞}}}$ — infinitesimally. The answer: $I(x)=\underset{—}{\overset{—}{\dot{∞}}}$. Math is art.

## Homework

1) It's simple to write software for PSS. But there must be ways to simplify drawing schemes in everyday situations. It ts needed to make a set of templates convenient for starting drawing in different purposes: consideration of logical mistakes, consideration of false links, solving the problems of the probability theory, solving strategical problems, and so on. Any technical and design suggestions?
