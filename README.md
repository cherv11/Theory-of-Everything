Looking back at the history of human civilization, I ask one question all the time: «And why didn't we think of it before?» Everything turned out to be so simple, that it's hard to believe, but it was extremely difficult to do that. I decided to announce the discovery only after fifteen thousand hours of collecting and processing information from the Internet and my own mind. For move than five years I have been looking for and discovering the methods of improving thinking, smoothly turning from psychology and cognitive science to history and narratology. I have found many lost regularities of ancient Greek culture and recreated many mathematical and philosophical conflicts. And also I am a... programmer. There are not many sources in my works, because the main source for me is popular science videos from YouTube, and the most of the information have been stored in my memory as concepts for years. The works were written in popular-scientific style: they use clear comparisons, cultural memes, and they explain complex things with simple language. It is because I am confident that everybody should read this works, even if he doesn't want to go through complicated formulas.

For all that, I have worked in terrible conditions for more than ten hours a day. I have lost my friends. My father died in 28 November, 2022, aged 73, the same day I understood what actually <veiled/> is. He, as the rest of people around, didn't know anything about what I am working on, but I know he would never forgive me if I stopped, and he would be proud of me. There are seventeen articles in this series, all are devoted to the main sciences and the greatest mysteries of humankind. All this is completely ready and stored in my brain and my notes, and hence it will be published as soon as possible. Here is the list of articles with short annotations:

I. [Probabilistic-Strategic Schemes as the best way to organize information in the Universe][1] 

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">The unification of the theory of graphs, the theory of sets and the theory of probability. All you want to know about asymmetric correlation, the chains of probabilities, and the types of sets, links, and recursions. </p>

II. [All educational and scientific literature in the world must be rewritten][2] 

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">Mathematically exact philosophy of science, usage of metaphorical thinking, the solution of the barber (self-reference) paradox, the refutation of the Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and new answers to the David Hilbert's questions</p>

V. The standard model of strategical particles

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">A new science unifying economy and the evolution theory, allowing representing any possible idea as a set of particle interactions, or infinite-dimensional function, conducting metaphors between sciences, and being actually the graph dynamics.</p>
